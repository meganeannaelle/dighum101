**ABSTRACT**


**Introduction**

Sexual Health Education was first formally introduced to American schools in the 1910s. More than 100 years later, it continues to be a hot topic; not just within schools, but in the larger societal sphere. Today, many still consider it taboo, and use these ideas to promote systemic violence around sexual health against marginalized identities. In fact, many laws on sexual health are based on the lessons students are taught in their sex-ed courses (whether they are misconceptions or not). Because sexual health education is incredibly important, itâ€™s critical that we reflect on how comprehensive it is. But can we say we have progressed in the way sexual health education is taught in schools? What has changed (positively or negatively) within the last century and what do we need to do better?


**Research Question**

Through this project, I aim to analyze how modern (~ 2022) sexual health education differs in comparison to the education provided a century (~1922) ago. Which topics in sexual education do they focus on/valued more and what is the tone in which this information is provided?


**Materials**

To collect textual data around sexual health education, I researched for modern text on free ebook stores & researched for older text by diving through the Library of Congress and Internet Archive. 

For my modern texts (2010s~202s), I chose:
1. _Sex Education for Boys: A Parent's Guide: Practical Advice on Puberty, Sex, and Relationships_, an advice book for parents to learn how to teach their teenage sons about puberty, sex, and relationships, 
2. _Losing It: Sex Education for the 21st Century_, a sexual health mythbusting book that challenges sex miseducation to empower people with agency around their sexual lives,
3. and a suggested, all-encompassing lesson plan for teaching students about sexual health.

For older texts (1910s~1920s), I chose :
1. _What a young man ought to know, a book that provides advice to young men about sex & relationships_ (I wanted to even the playing field between modern and older text by choosing another book geared towards men),
2. _High schools and sex education A manual of suggestions on education related to sex_, a book that provides advice to tachers on how to discuss & educate sexual within a high school setting, and
3. _The education of the young in sex hygiene; a textbook for parents and teachers_, similar to a lesson plan, a handbook for teachers & parents to educate students on sexual health.


**Methods**

I will be building my analysis through a comparison of textual data between modern sexual health education books & suggested topical lesson plans and the books/suggested lesson plans from a century ago. The methods I will be using include text frequency analysis to analyze which sexual health related words (marginalized identites, sexual purity & disease, important topics in sexual health, body autonomy) appeared more frequently between old and new text, POS Tagging to help clarify different meanings of a word depending on context, TF-IDF scoring to analyze the importance of a word within a text, and a sentiment analysis to analyze the varying tone of voice between modern & older text.


**Results**

Through my project, I expect to see an improvement/progression in the language & topics explored within sexual health education from older texts to modern texts. Because the textual data I use for older texts is when sexual health education was first introduced into schools (1920s), I assume it will largely be focused on sexual purity and family values. I hypothesize that the language in the modern text will not only be more inclusive of identities & comprehensive of important sexual health topics, but it will also have a more neutral, positive tone. 


**Discussion**

As the project implies, these days, we have plenty of resources we can leverage to teach comprehensive sexual education to young children, even including suggested lesson plan. The question that is left to us is will we use it? We may be in 2022, but it wouldn't come to a shock to us that different regions and different schools may be inclined to use texts from 1972 or even 1922, reflecting the ideas of those times rather than the progressives modern texts experts have built & organized. Hopefully, as time passes, sexual health education will not only be normalized, but also be comprehensive, highlighting various intersectional identities, topics surrounding consent & sexual agency, and proper knowledge of anatomy. By being intentional with the way we educate our children and our society on sexual health, we can essentially protect the most vulnerable in our society from sexual violence, preserve the values of bodily autonomy, and empower people to make good sexual health decisions (enthusiastic consent, family planning, etc.).
